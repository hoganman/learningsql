#learningsql

This repository is a walkthrough of the book "Learning SQL" by Alan Beaulieu.

Included with this walkthrough is how powerful an ORM like SQLAlchemy is.

Raw queries are interpreted using Pandas. Most queries will be compared with the
established model with SQLAlchemy. Depending on the query type, a simple raw query
is easier to read and interpret, but complex or multiple joins are easier
with the ORM.


The example SQL database is included in this repository in `LearningSQLExample.sql`

An ER diagram is also included below.
